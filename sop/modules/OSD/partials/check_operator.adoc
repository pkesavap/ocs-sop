Checking on the OCS operator status involves checking the operator subscription status and the operator pod health.

==== OCS Operator Subscription Health

.Check the ocs-operator subscription status
----
oc get sub $(oc get pods -n openshift-storage | grep -v ocs-operator) -n openshift-storage  -o json | jq .status.conditions
----

Like all operators, the status conditions types are:

*CatalogSourcesUnhealthy, InstallPlanMissing, InstallPlanPending, InstallPlanFailed*

The status for each type should be False. For example:

```
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2021-01-26T19:21:37Z",
    "message": "all available catalogsources are healthy",
    "reason": "AllCatalogSourcesHealthy",
    "status": "False",
    "type": "CatalogSourcesUnhealthy"
  }
]
```
The output above shows a false status for type CatalogSourcesUnHealthly, meaning the catalog sources are healthy.

==== OCS Operator Pod Health

Check the OCS operator pod status to see if there is an OCS operator upgrading in progress.

WIP: Find specific status for upgrade (pending?)

.To find and view the status of the OCS operator:
----
 oc get pod -n openshift-storage | grep ocs-operator
 OCSOP=$(oc get pod -n openshift-storage  -o custom-columns=POD:.metadata.name --no-headers | grep ocs-operator)
 echo $OCSOP
 oc get pod/${OCSOP} -n openshift-storage
 oc describe pod/${OCSOP} -n openshift-storage
----

If you determine the OCS operator is in progress, please be patient, wait 5 minutes and this alert should resolve itself. 

If you have waited or see a different error status condition, please continue troubleshooting.
